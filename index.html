# Alumni Association Survey Results

April 11, 2016

---

class: middle

# Methodology

* The survey was administered to the Facebook Alumni Group (753 alumni, about 65% of all past attendees).
* There were 62 respondents (about 5.4% of all past attendees).
* Respondents were asked a series of "I" statements using the Likert scale.
  * Strongly Disagree = 1
  * Disagree = 2
  * Neutral = 3
  * Agree = 4
  * Strongly Agree = 5

class: middle

# Limitations

* Selection bias is likely to overweight the importance of Facebook.
* Survey design probably has several ambiguous questions.
* Meta-point: some alumni did not see this in their Facebook feed; Facebook is
  not a highly reliable communication medium.

# Conclusions

---

class: middle

* The school has a huge opportunity for alumni to support it in non-monetary ways.
* Alumni want to keep the annual "End of the World" event.
* Alumni want to institute "annual Throwback Thursday" on Facebook.  I humbly
  propose the first Thursday in March, apropos Pi day.
* Alumni want to understand how gifts are used; future work should determine
  whether Foundation communications and processes are sufficient in this regard.
* Alumni want to communicate via email and Facebook, and not via LinkedIn or snail mail.
* Alumni seem willing to volunteer their basic contact info, such as email,
  link to Facebook account, and optionally, their current location.
* Generally, LinkedIn and information used for networking purposes would not be
  uniformly used; as such it should be considered a secondary priority.
* Alumni hate snail-mail clearly seem to prefer digital communication, though I
  believe reliability will be a key concern for fundraising.

# Suggestions

---

class: middle

* Build a new alumni database with alumni use cases in mind, the goal of which
  will be to connect alumni with each other and the school.
* The school should brainstorm the top 3 ways alumni could support in in
  non-monetary ways and report back.  For example, does the school foresee
  using college(s) attended or profession(s) if an alumni registry were
  created?
* Consider how to reliably reach alumni digitally, vs. the annual snail-mail
  campaign.  Perhaps have a Facebook page for the Foundation, or do quarterly
  emails?
